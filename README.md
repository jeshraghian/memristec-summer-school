# memristec-summer-school
Notebooks for Memristec Summer School (Dresden, Germany) for the presentation *A Hands-On Approach to Open-Source Memristive Neuromorphic Systems*.

There are two notebooks in this repo:

* One for training spiking neural networks using snnTorch
* One for running several neuromorphic designs through the OpenLane flow using the Sky130 PDK
